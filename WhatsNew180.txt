    viewer.

[-] Correct order of classes is shown for dual-class characters.

[-] The StrRef lookup dialog now correctly shows texts with lines
    separated with LF characters.

[-] The "Save current file" action was sometimes enabled when there
    was no actual current file, and invoking the action produced
    unpredictable results.

[-] Search for code found the code only in one script file, and did
    not process further occurrences. Now the search processes all
    occurrences correctly.

[-] Hyperlinks in the last line of a script were not highlighted
    correctly.
