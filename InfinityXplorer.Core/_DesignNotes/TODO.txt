In a picture frame with a case of the following situation:

HH = HEIGHT of frame
WW = WIDTH of frame

sx = size of picture width
sy = size of picture height

px = point x that you want to centralise
py = point y that you want to centralise

Then the offset from top & left are:

top  = py - HH/2 + dy == 0 | py - HH/2 | sy - HH
left = px - WW/2 + dx == 0 | px - WW/2 | sx - WW

where:
if the boundaries are not reached, then d = d = 0

if top boundary is reached, ie. p < H/2 then d = H/2-p

if bottom boundary is reached, ie. (s - p) < H/2 then d = -[H/2-(s-p)]
