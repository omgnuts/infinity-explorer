// Chitin.key / biff / dialog
---------------------------

If you want to build the chitin.key file, you need a BIFF-CHITIN relationship
just do a one-time pass in the chitinkey and use an collection of biffLists 
and add each chitinkey to the relevant arraylist. 

you only need to do this at the end of the day, with a clean-up function.

NEVER LOAD UP THE BIFF->CHITIN relationship at the start of the program. 
as most operations wouldn't need this link.

At present the CHITIN-BIFF relationship is available in the ChitinSuperDick

- need a relook at the way caching should be done for cd-biffs
- what is cdmask??
- how to extract BIFC - compressed files? zlib c#
