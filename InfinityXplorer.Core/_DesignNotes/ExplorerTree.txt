// IXplorer Tree Structure
---------------------------

The tree structures are defined by the infinity engine's file types.
Extensions can be made easily as the structure is contained within 
the following files:

- ResourceStruct.cs - defines the all the resource types

Only need to edit ResourceStruct.cs to change more filetypes

Further note that only the signatures identified in IIXTreeNode should have 
public access. The rest of the methods in ResourceNodes should be kept in 
private access.

Need to do some checks to not reload the viewer if already active. 
Unless inactive, load from cache if possible, else load from file. [ done]
