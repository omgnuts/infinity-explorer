Infinity Explorer is a game data browser for games built with the BioWare
Infinity Engine. It supports four games using that engine, namely
Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows
of Amn.

This release is the last version of Infinity Explorer to be ever released
by me. It is unfinished and untested, but it contains several new features
that I developed after the release of the version 0.75. The main reason for
this release is constant pinging by Jason Compton, so thank him if you
find it useful.

The current version of Infinity Explorer can display the following types of
game data:

 * Dialogs (*.DLG);
 * AI scripts (*.BSC);
 * Static graphics (*.MOS, *.BMP);
 * Animations (*.BAM);
 * Area maps (*.MAP);
 * Area contents (*.ARE);
 * Text data files (*.INI, *.2DA, *.IDS);
 * Creatures (*.CRE);
 * Items (*.ITM);
 * Spells (*.SPL);
 * User interface screens (*.CHU);
 * World maps (*.WMP);
 * Store files (*.STO);
 * Savegames;
 * Planescape: Torment quests.

Infinity Explorer supports exporting graphics to the following formats:

 * Windows Bitmap (*.BMP);
 * Animated GIF (*.GIF);
 * JPEG (*.JPG).

Infinity Explorer is written in Delphi 7 and distributed under GNU General
Public License. This means that the full source code of the program is
available for download.

The Infinity Engine File Format Hacking Project
<http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~jedwin/baldur.html>
by Eddy L O Jansson, Petr Zahradnik and Jed Wing is a great source of
information about the internals of Infinity Engine. Much of the information
I used when developing Infinity Explorer comes from that site.
